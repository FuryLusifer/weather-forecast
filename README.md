# Weather Forecast App

The Weather Forecast App is a Java-based application that provides real-time weather updates using the OpenWeather API. Built with Java Swing for a rich graphical user interface (GUI) and JSON parsing for efficient data retrieval, this app allows users to check the current weather conditions for any city worldwide. The app is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and extensible for future improvements.


## Features

- Real-Time Weather Data: Displays current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed) based on the selected city.
- Beautiful GUI: User-friendly interface built using Java Swing with visually appealing icons (cloud, rain, sun) based on weather conditions.
- Global Accessibility: Users can check weather updates for cities across the globe.
- API Integration: Powered by the OpenWeather API for accurate and reliable weather information.
- Loading Animation: Includes a loading animation (loading.gif) during data fetch from the API.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 23 or higher
